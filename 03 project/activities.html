                A university is an institution of higher education that offers academic programs and degrees at the undergraduate, graduate, and sometimes postgraduate levels. Universities typically consist of multiple faculties, departments, and schools, each offering courses and programs in a specific field of study. Some universities are also research-intensive, with faculty members conducting original research and producing scholarly publications.
